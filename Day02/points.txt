Data Structures
----------------
1. List
2. Dictionary
3. Tuple
4. Set


List
------
lists are similar to arrays

what is an array?
Collection of homogenous data
Memory allocation is contagious

Lists are a collection of heterogenous data
Memory allocation is not contagious
Lists are ordered collection of data
Lists are mutable
lists are subscriptable
lists are enclosed in [ ]

lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

append - to add one value at a time
extend - to add more than one value
remove - remove elements from the list
pop  - to remove elements from the list - pop 	returns the value that was removed
copy - copy a list into another list
sort - sort the list based on the data stored in it

sort
----
1. sort - will sort the original list
2. sorted - take a copy of the list and sort it

Dictionary
----------
its also called as associative arrays

 0    1    2    3    4    5 
'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'

{0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c', 3: 'd', 4: 'e', 5: 'f'}
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> Keys
'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' - values

Keys
----
keys in a dictionary should always be unique
keys are user defined

stud - {'name': 'Jack', 'age': 24, 'gender': 'male'}

dictionaries are unordered collections
They are mutable
they are enclosed in {} with a key and value stored in it.

fromkeys
setdefault
clear
update
keys
get


Tuples
------
tuples are immutable lists

tuples are enclosed in ( )

set
---
sets are collection of unique values
sets are unordered collection
sets cannot be subscripted (cannot be indexed)
sets are mutable
set are enclosed in { }

Functions
---------
what are functions?

def fun():
   print("hello world")


recursive calls
---------------
1. find the factorial of a number
2. find the Fibonacci series 



Time and space complexity -  sorting methods
---------------------------------------------
Ajay 	- Merge sort
Nikhil  - Selection sort
Vinay   - Bubble sort
Utkarsh - Quick sort
Shatanshu - Heap sort


Scripting tools
---------------
C   - language features
C++ - OOPS


Scope of a variable
-------------------
1. global
2. local
3. non local


Lambdas
-------
anonymous function with a single expression

result_of_expression = lambda var1, var2, var3... : expression

map is like a dye - x / 2


Decorator
---------
